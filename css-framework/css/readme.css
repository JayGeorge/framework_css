CSS min(), max(), and clamp()

- min() — the value used in all situations will be the smallest of the possibilities.
- max() — the value used in all situations will be the largest of the possibilities.
- clamp() — accepts three values or calculations: a minimum, preferred, and a maximum. The minimum or maximum will be used if the computed value falls below the minimum or above the maximum. The preferred value will be used if the computed value falls between the two. This allows the property value to adapt to changes in the element or page it is assigned to, while remaining between the minimum and maximum values.

h1 {
    font-size: clamp(
    1.1em,  // min - the value is set at this by default. This sholud be a good legible value on smaller screens. Don't worry too much about dramatic type scale.
    5vw,    // value - when 5vw is bigger than 1.5rem then the font-size becomes 5vw. Don't worry too much about dramatic type scale.
    1.414em // max - when 5vw hits 1.414em, it stays there as the max. Here is where you should concentrate on aligning to a more dramatic type scale.
    );
}

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp
The <h1> element's font-size is set as clamp(1.8rem, 2.5vw, 2.8rem). This means that the font-size will be set at 1.8rem, until the computed value of 2.5vw becomes greater than that of 1.8rem. At this point, font-size will be set at 2.5vw, until 2.5vw's computed value becomes greater than that of 2.8rem. At this point, the font-size will be set at 2.8rem. clamp() allows you to set a minimum and maximum value.

Variable font-size and line-height example...
(variables are bumped up and down in :root)

font-size: var(--font-size-l-1);
line-height: var(--font-size-height-l-1);

/* GROUP ELEMENTS / FRAMEWORK / TEXT / LINK STYLES {/ LINKS} / ACCESSIBILITY / FOCUS
=================================================== */
/* Notes...

    Focus = obvious
    hover = subtle

    - After some thinking I've concluded that...
        - A _really_ obvious outline maybe combined with a soft hue'd background is the best for outline styles
        - Use outline on links but box-shadow if you're dealing with buttons or form elements with a border-radius
        - It's best to make outlines for keyboard users extremely obvious but then remove them totally for non-keyboard users (see 'Remove Focus Styles for Mouse Users' below)
            - I think extreme both sides is better than going for a middle of the road approach which still offends designers but is very easy to use for keyboard users

    e.g. 

    Example 1 - taken from apple.com
    ---------
    .el:focus {
        outline: 4px solid rgba(0,125,250,0.6);
        outline-offset: 1px;
    }

    Example 2 - box-shadow example from Statamic cpanel
    ---------
    .el:focus {
        outline: none;
        box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(0,125,255,.25);
    }

    Example 3 - apple.com but more subtle
    ---------
    .el:focus {
        outline: 4px solid white;
        outline-offset: 4px;
    }

    Example 4
    ---------
    .el:focus {
        outline: 3px solid hsla(var(--colour-turquoise-hsl),0.2);
        text-decoration: none;
        background: hsla(var(--colour-turquoise-hsl),0.2);
        border-bottom: 2px solid hsla(var(--colour-turquoise-hsl),0.8);
    }

*/
/* .u-focus-style-1 a:focus,
.s-entry-content a:focus {
    outline: 3px solid hsla(var(--colour-turquoise-hsl),0.2);
    text-decoration: none;
    background: hsla(var(--colour-turquoise-hsl),0.2);
    border-bottom: 2px solid hsla(var(--colour-turquoise-hsl),0.8);
} */

/* Notes...

    - Use "u-link-style-custom" prefix then these are pretty much rare/1 off
    - Still include them in this group so we can see all link styles for easy maintenance

/* GROUP ELEMENTS / FRAMEWORK / TEXT / LINK STYLES {/ LINKS} / ACCESSIBILITY / HOVER
=================================================== */
/* Notes...

    Focus = obvious
    hover = subtle

    Subtle effects such as going from light grey to black are best for hover. We want to gentle suggest rather than pop out, like we do with focus.

    - Consider descending from p so we don't affect buttons e.g. reply button for blog comments
    - Consider darkening the underline/border-bottom color on hover, or removing the border on hover
    - Consider going from light grey to black e.g. navigation hover events

    e.g. 

    .el {
        color: #eee;
    }
    
    .el:hover {
        color: black;
    }

*/




/* GROUP COMPONENTS / FRAMEWORK / BUTTONS
=================================================== */
/* Notes...

    Wrap the .c-btn around the a href instead of the other way around because this is the most valid HTML.
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5320404/wrap-link-a-around-div

    <div class="btn">
        <a href>
        </a>
    </div>

/* These should be slightly different to focus states. Subtle effects such as changing the background color from blue to darkblue are best for hover. We want to gently suggest rather than pop out (opposite of focus states).

    - Consider darkening the background color slightly e.g. blue to darkblue
    - Here is a good example...
